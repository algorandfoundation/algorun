# Algorun for contributors

## Commits

We are using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) standard for commit messages. This allows us to automatically generate release notes and version numbers. We do this via [Python Semantic Release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [GitHub actions](.github/workflows/cd.yaml).
