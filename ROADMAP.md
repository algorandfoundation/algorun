# Algorun CLI Roadmap

## Road to v1

- Guides on how to register for consensus
- Implement `status` command that wraps `goal node status -w 1000` so users don't have to remember that command
- Implement `log` command for users to see container logs
- Implement a tui, possibly [node ui](https://github.com/algorand/node-ui) or maybe a gui
